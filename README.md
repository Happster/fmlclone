Installation
============
For simplicity, I have bundled the application with Yii framework.
* Download the files and dump on your localhost/server
* Create a database using command line or a tool like phpMyAdminImport and import db.sql
* Edit protected/config/main.php and provide database details. Save it.
* I guess that's all. Simple .. isn't it?
